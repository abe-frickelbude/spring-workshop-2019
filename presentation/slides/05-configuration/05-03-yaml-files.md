### Configuration 

##### YAML files

* Structure your configuration files
* Document your configuration
* Keep a consistent naming convention for properties
* Group related properties
* Use environment variable substitution where appropriate
 
Note:
 -  Use comments to delineate individual config sections
 - Provide default values as necessary / where possible
 - Explain default values
 - defaults:  keep in mind that URLs and other strings containing ":" won't work here
 - Tip: show how to separate logging configuration for DEV and PROD
