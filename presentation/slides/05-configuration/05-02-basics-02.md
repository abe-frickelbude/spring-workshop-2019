### Configuration 

##### Basics

* Use @Bean to explicitly define additional beans
* Remember - config classes are also "usual" Spring-managed beans
* Avoid mixing configuration and component code
* Do *not* expose individual config values as beans
* Do not annotate your own config classes with @AutoConfiguration

Note:

- Keep in mind the bean factory's semantics
  - @Bean-annotated methods are proxied - calls to these will cached instances if possible 
- "usual" spring Beans meaning:
  - Usual DI options works here as well
  - Ditto for @Value
- Avoid mixing configuration and component code
  - Configure stuff in separate classes
  - Put all config classes into a separate package, e.g "config"
- no @AutoConfiguration unless you are actually writing an auto-configurable extension library
