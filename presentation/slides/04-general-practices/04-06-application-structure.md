### General practices

##### Application structure

* Structure your code as services
* Keep services stateless where possible

Note:

* DDD and some Spring practices don't always mix well
* Observing a consistent package structure is a good idea
* Prefer business logic in services to business logic in DTOs
* Pay attention to data flow between services
