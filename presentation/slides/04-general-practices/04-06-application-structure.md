##### Application structure

* Structure your code as services
* Keep services stateless where possible
* Pay attention to data flow between services
* Prefer business logic in services to business logic in DTOs


Note:
- Explain why DDD and some Spring practices don't always mix well
- Explain why observing a consistent package structure is a good idea
