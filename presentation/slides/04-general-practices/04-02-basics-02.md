### General practices 

##### Basics

* Stick to Spring's DI annotations
* There's nothing magical about DI - learn to use it effectively
* Exercise patience when reading Spring documentation
* StackOverflow iz your friend

Note:

- do not use or mix with javax.inject
(This can make sense if porting existing JEE code that already uses CDI)
- In all due likelihood you won't port your Spring code to another DI framework
- DI can be used as glue between any components which are not static (i.e. in PermGen space)
