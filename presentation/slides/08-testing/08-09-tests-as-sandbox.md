### Testing

##### Tests as an R&D laboratory

* Use Spring-enabled tests as playground for code fragments
* Explore various Spring facilities and components
* Test application contexts for correct configuration / composition
* Explore component behavior (e.g in multi-threaded environment) 

Note:

- Explain how a Spring-enabled test can be used as a simple
experimental lab setup for playing around with Spring code

- Advantages: quick setup/teardown, separate isolated configuration,
no need to modify productive code

- Explain how to test app context initialization
(possibly using a separate configuration)
