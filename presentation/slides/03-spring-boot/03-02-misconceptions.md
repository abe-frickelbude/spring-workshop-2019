### Spring Boot

##### SpringBoot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --remove-bs

* SpringBoot is **not** a microservice framework
* SpringBoot is **not** a web application framework
* Using SpringBoot requires firm understanding of core Spring concepts
* The ecosystem is still fairly young and is rapidly evolving


Note:
* SpringBoot  is build _upon_ Spring - it is an _add-on_ 
* It is entirely possible to design non-web / non-server applications using SpringBoot
* Documentation is already very comprehensive and fairly reliable
  * Implication: integration of third-party frameworks may be buggy or not feature-complete
