### Spring Boot

##### Basic facts

* SpringBoot is **not** a microservice framework
* SpringBoot is **not** a web application framework
* Understanding of core Spring concepts is required
* The ecosystem is under active development

Note:

* SpringBoot  is build _upon_ Spring - it is an _add-on_
* It is entirely possible to design non-web / non-server applications using SpringBoot
* Documentation is already very comprehensive and fairly reliable
  * Implication: integration of third-party frameworks may be buggy or not feature-complete
