### Intro 

##### Overview

* Spring Framework introduction
* Strongly opinionated

<!-- Speaker notes -->
Note:

- Introduce Spring as product
- When and when not to use Spring?
- Name some pros and cons
- Leave enough time / room for Q&A 
- Allow Q&A in-between
- Time is limited - Keep the pace!
- Don't give into to pro/con discussions
- Intersperse theory with code examples
- Talk about anti-patterns / bad examples during a particular chapter, not after it
- don't spend too much time with Spring documentation
